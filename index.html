        <p>Hello, my name is Tiffany Lalampaa and I am from Nairobi, Kenya. As you can see from the photo above I love traveling and this shot was staken two weeks ago when my friends and I(CITAM CFS group) visited the coast of Diani. We used the train(one of the fast developing means of transport in our country) to get there and that is where my background comes in. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Aside from that I enjoy cooking sometimes. I find it calming and also creates room for creativity! </p>
