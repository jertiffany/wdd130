        <p>Hello, my name is Tiffany Lalampaa and I am from Nairobi, Kenya. As you can see from the photo above I love traveling and this shot was staken two weeks ago when my friends and I(CITAM CFS group) visited the coast of Diani. We used the train(one of the fast developing means of transport in our country) to get there and that is where my background comes in. I thoroughly enjoyed myself. Aside from that I enjoy cooking sometimes. I find it calming and also creates room for creativity! </p>

      <p>Kenya is located in East Africa. Its terrain rises from a low coastal plain on the Indian Ocean to mountains and plateaus at its center. Most Kenyans live in the highlands, where Nairobi, the capital, sits at an altitude of 5,500 feet (1,700 meters).</p>
